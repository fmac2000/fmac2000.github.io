	Our week consisted of a lot of experiments in set design and 3D website functionalities. 
	I started by looking at fashion runway design and the topics explored in them by looking into 
	surreal / expressionist art movements. Through research I stumbled across German abstract 
	expressionism and was particularly interested in their 1920s horror genre of film. I was 
	drawn to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and the set design they adopted, using weird, surreal 
	shapes and harsh shadows. I asked Yuru who is a extremely talented 3D modeller to create a 
	set based on some drawing I made. While waiting for that to be made, I began the fundamental 
	navigation code for the website to allow the user to walk around a 3D model without walking 
	through walls or objects. Unfortunately, Yuru's model was far too complex to render on a website, 
	leaving us stumped. However, Yuru showed me the work of James Turrell and I realised that it 
	would be a perfect match for our requirements as it has simple geometry with expressive and 
	surreal lighting. I figured we could bake the lighting as a texture for the model, allowing for 
	fast website loading and rendering with detailed and beautiful scenes. Our battle is always to 
	do with sharing files as we often send each other the incorrect files or in the wrong format. 
	I guess our common ground is luckily in 3D modeling and rendering. Also, its lucky to get a group 
	member who shares my taste and ideas allowing us to move past the hardest part of designing. 
	Moving forward, I would like to expand this piece away from 3D renders and into real-time 
	rendering of the same fidelity. - should be cool - I made this in a 3D modelling program and 
	spent the last week trying to figure it out, absolute nightmare.</p>
	<p>After systematic research and discussion. We chose Plato's allegory of the cave as the core 
	concept of building our digital platform. It is a frequent reference when alluding to film and 
	video - related to projection. We absorbed this theory as a metaphor to interpret the nature of 
	the digital world in relation to reality. The essential difference between these two is that when 
	you zoom into the digital world until the size of one pixel by one pixel. It is just a color block, 
	a square, But when you enlarge a cell, in reality, it still has an infinite and invisible world 
	inside. So the digital world is like the cave, what you see is what the world it is. Viewer's 
	realization and value of the world is formed by these "lighting and shadow" as same as in Plato's 
	cave.
	I found James Turrell's work is also involved with light and space. In his work, light is the revelation,
	 and perception is the object of study. We utilized it as a visual reference in terms of lighting and 
	 shadow.
	Frazer was focused on website skills and I was mainly specialized in 3D modeling. This website is an 
	interior filled by lighting and some shadows of our movement which we scanned and turned into a 3D module 
	appear in this space. This website allows viewers to explore their investigation of light, space, and 
	perception. We actually tried more modules. But due to the loading speed, they are way too complex for a 
	computer to render. Thanks to Frazer, we do not only have the same interest and taste in module and 
	rendering. He is also a workaholic. He kept coding and uploading for several non-sleep nights. We 
	need to carry on finishing it and focus on the baking and rendering.

 WEEK 1
 </h1>
 <p>
Our first week began with an old idea I've had that could expand on the classic website model. I saw that the 
technology for an immersive and interactive website could be made with the existing libraries and systems that 
are available to everyone today. The link to the brief fits nicely as I believe the theme explores the idea of 
"liminality" as it examines the passing of one state to another, in this case being the passing of the traditional 
into the futuristic. After discussing ideas in my group we still felt as this initial idea was the strongest for a 
couple reasons. Our main attraction to this was bluntly that we think it would look good on a portfolio. The degree 
of technical ability is quite advanced and would be a good showcase of our skills and talent. I've seen previous 
examples of these 3D sites however, I believe them to be quite uninspired and lacking artistic aesthetic. Having 
received the brief on Tuesday with the hand-in on Thursday we did pretty well to get on with an idea. The timezone 
difference and Chinese firewall made it incredibly hard to negotiate files between our computers however, after much 
back and forth we managed to transfer. I have much interest in modern technology and felt it slides nicely into our 
idea, so we began scanning our faces using Record3D and creating a few scenes in C4D. I added these into Sketchfab 
and began recording some very basic shots and composition for the video. I decided to add some J Dilla into the mix 
to make it a slam dunk.

 Reflecting on our wired life status currently, we were intrigued by the liminal space between reality and digital 
 world-our daily communication with others is connected by screens.The digital world is somehow taking over reality 
 during the lockdown period. The boundary is getting ambiguous. Our initial idea is re-creating our CSM campus by 
 building a model and scan CSM students’s faces to upload on a website. We intend to recreate the campus by collecting 
 people's memory about the campus so that it is not exactly as same as it in reality. It is a liminal space between our
 memory and the real campus which refers to our concept about liminal space. Viewers are able to navigate themselves 
 in "CSM campus" by moving mouse and interact with student's faces in this network platform. We wish to evoke viewers' 
 emotion of this place especially people from CSM and rethink about reality and the digital world afterwards.
We tried to scan our faces on Record3D app and I built a draft model of my flat in London according to my inaccurate 
memory to visualize our concept. There are some technical problems that we need to figure out, the right format to 
upload, the coding of interaction with viewers and the speed of loading, etc.

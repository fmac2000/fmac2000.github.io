 <h1>
 WEEK 3
 </h1>
 <p>
 Taking Abbie's feedback from last week, we decided that our next piece had to have some sort of narrative / meaning 
 behind it. Previously, we discussed that the cave allegory might be a suitable topic to explore in the piece as it 
 explains our current growth in online technology. The cave allegory although written in ancient Greece, deals with 
 the limitation in perception that every generation faces and that we should be more aware that not everything you 
 see is reality. In the context of our pieces, I argue that technology may / has become the new forum in which we 
 experience the world through. Moving forward a couple years, I can see this blurring of the digital and the real 
 world become more and more apparent. For the piece, I decided it would be boring just to narrate the cave allegory 
 and instead used a Kubrickian form of storytelling where the concept is oblique, leaving the interpretation up to 
 the viewer.

 This week we still focus on Plato's cave theory. We would like to express the difference between the world in 
 "caves" and the world outside "caves" through the contrast between black and white and color, static and dynamic, 
 regular shapes and surreal shapes. At the same time, we combined physical images with virtual realities. Those two 
 are becoming increasingly intertwined. We also discussed how to combine real-life images with established virtual 
 worlds. We thought about projecting real-world images on the website we built. But it would take forever to upload. 
 I really like the video of one of the artists Keiichi Matsuda introduced by Abbie. She effectively interacted with 
 reality and the web interface. For developing our site, we would like to design a more surreal setting in different 
 rooms to express how illusory the world seen by imprisoned people is. We researched some artists and surrealist films 
 in order to flourish this fantasy land.In terms of the third film, we introduced some real figures into our built 
 scene, the contrast between the historical architecture and the uncanny audio represent our idea of eliminating the 
 existing biases and cliche. Our generation should embrace the new world.
